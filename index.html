    <p>Becoming a Christian doesn't mean you have to be a boring person. You can still have fun and enjoy life in Christ. But we often don't hear about the fun things that Christians get to enjoy. Christians get to experience a joy that others outside of Christ do not get to experience. It is a joy that is unspeakable!</p>
    
    <p> Being a Christian is the best decision you could ever make in your life. Jesus doesn't want you to live a strict religious life void of joy and happiness. He wants you to enjoy life and life more abundantly in Him without compromising your spiritual beliefs. </p>
    
    <p> So stop being a fuddy-duddy and go have some good clean fun!</p>
